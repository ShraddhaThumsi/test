        Bharatnatyam is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and neighboring regions. Traditionally,Bharatanatyam has been a solo dance that was performed exclusively by women, and expressed Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism.
        The name Bharatanatyam is a simple derivation from the four most important aspects of dance (in Sanskrit). These are: Bha from Bhava meaning emotion, Ra from Raaga meaning music or melody, Ta from Taala meaning rhythm and Natyam meaning dance.
    What particularly interests me about dance is the research studies proving that dance and music therapy can help patients with cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple other chronic ailments.
    Having learnt a little Bharatnatyam myself, the experience is liberating, one that can only be felt.
